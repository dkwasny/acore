// A particularly nasty resolver needed to reasonably handle spell variables.
// Most of them leverage conditionals which inherently return strings instead
// of numbers.
// I could create a numeric conditional type for use in variables, but one
// variable set (1) leverages the "${formula}.decimalPlaces" syntax, which
// is inherently tied to the string return type.
// In the end I _could_ have better typing, but just adding a parser resolver
// is simpler both in the grammar and the codebase itself.
// Maybe consider revisiting if number parsing is low performance (unlikely).

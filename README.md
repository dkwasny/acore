Acore App
=========

[![Build](https://github.com/dkwasny/acore-app/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dkwasny/acore-app/actions/workflows/main.yml)

A project for learning Spring Boot, React, Typescript, and other tech as I go along.

Intended to be a fun little dashboard for the MySQL database backing the [AzerothCore](https://www.azerothcore.org/) WoW server emulator.

### How to Run
1. `gradlew bootRun` to start Spring Boot
2. Optional: `gradlew viteRun` in a separate terminal to start the Vite dev UI server
3. Open the app in your web browser based on what UI server you're using
    * Spring Boot: `http://localhost:8080`
    * Vite Dev: `http://localhost:5173`
